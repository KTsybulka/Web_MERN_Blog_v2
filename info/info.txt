Mountain

A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.[1]

Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years.[2] Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.[3]

High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.

Jungle Amazon



The Amazon Rainforest has been in existence nearly 55 million years. However, it was not always the vast, lush forest we know today.  About 15million years ago the Amazon was just a large inland sea formed from the Andes blocking the rivers that flowed through that area. It eventually became a large swamp, fresh water lake shortly after, creating the vast fresh water animal population the Amazon hosts today. 10 million years ago waters began working the sandstone to the west, which prompted the Amazon to flow eastward, creating the Amazon rainforest. The Ice Age made sea levels drop, which turned the great Amazon Lake into a river. Other Ice Ages were thought to have cause the Amazon to revert back to savanna and montane forest. The savanna caused pieces of the forest to turn into islands, separating the forest long enough “to allow genetic differentiation”, contributing to the Amazon’s vast ecosystem, including animal, insect, and plant populations. Today, the forest is becoming smaller and less diverse due to human activity. The Amazon Jungle is the common name among English speaking countries, but in Spanish it is referred to as Amazonía.
